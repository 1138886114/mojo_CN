# Mojoæ‰‹å†Œ

Welcome to the Mojo Manual, a complete guide to the MojoðŸ”¥ programming language!

Mojo is designed to solve a variety of AI development challenges that no other
language can, because Mojo is the first programming language built from the
ground-up with [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) (a compiler infrastructure that's
ideal for heterogeneous hardware, from CPUs and GPUs, to various AI ASICs). We
also designed Mojo as a superset of Python because we love Python and its
community, but we couldn't realistically enhance Python to do all the things we
wanted. For a longer discussion on this topic, read [Why
Mojo](/mojo/why-mojo.html).

Beware that Mojo is still a very young language, so there's a lot that hasn't
been built yet. Likewise, there's a lot of documentation that hasn't been
written yet. But we're excited to share Mojo with you and [get your
feedback](/mojo/community.html).
